# ðŸ§Š Product Analytics Pipeline on Snowflake

An end-to-end data pipeline project that simulates product event data, ingests it into Snowflake, performs layered transformations (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold), provisions Snowflake infrastructure using Terraform, and visualizes business metrics using a Streamlit dashboard.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Simulate synthetic product interaction data (clicks, purchases, sessions)
- Automate Snowflake infrastructure with Terraform
- Batch ingest event data using Python
- Perform multi-layer SQL transformations (bronze/silver/gold)
- Build a Streamlit dashboard connected to Snowflake
- Version control everything (code, infra, docs) in GitHub
